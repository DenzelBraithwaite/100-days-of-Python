# 100-days-of-Python

Following the 100 days of Python Udemy course, offered by Angela Yu. Every day is a new challenge and at the end of each day is a little project.
Although most days end with a project that I push to GitHub, there are certain days where the project is done on another website, with less of a focus on Python syntax, and more of a focus on the logic.
Personally, I've already completed a Full Stack web development course with Le Wagon, which uses Ruby as the back-end language.
Therefore, I won't be pushing those project(the beginner level) but I will follow along with the lecture.
This explains why you might notice a gap between days, it's simply because the project at the time wasn't really worth pushing.
My core focus at the moment is to continue learning JavaScript and React, so Python is more of a fun daily challenge than a serious professional goal.

If you're new to coding and would like to learn Python, I'd highly recommend buying Angela's course when it goes on sale (instead of 120$ CAD, it could be 20$)
