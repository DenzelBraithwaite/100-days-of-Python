# 100-days-of-Python

Following the 100 days of Python Udemy course, offered by Angela Yu. Every day is a new challenge and at the end of each day is a little project.
Although most days end with a project that I push to GitHub, there are certain days where the project is done on another website, with less of a focus on Python syntax, and more of a focus on the logic.
Personally, I've already completed a Full Stack web development course with Le Wagon, which uses Ruby as the back-end language.
Therefore, I won't be pushing those projects(the beginner level) but I will of course be following along with the lecture.
This explains why you might notice a gap between days, it's simply because the project at the time was using a third party website in the form of a game as opposed to a small project that's build from scratch. Those to me, are not really worth pushing, since it would only be valid on those websites, and not in a real Python project.
My core focus at the moment is to continue learning JavaScript and React, so Python is more of a fun daily challenge than a serious professional goal.

If you're new to coding and would like to learn Python, I'd highly recommend buying Angela's course when it goes on sale (instead of $120 CAD, it could be \$20)

Thanks for stopping by, stay awesome :)
